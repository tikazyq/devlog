  "description": "Refactor the devlog ID system from current semantic hash-based IDs to user-friendly incrementable integers. The current system uses descriptive hash-based identifiers which are not scalable and harder for users to reference. Need to implement auto-incrementing integer IDs while maintaining data integrity and providing migration path.",

    "businessContext": "Current semantic hash-based IDs (like 'web-ui-issues-investigation') are not scalable and create poor user experience. Users expect simple numeric IDs they can easily reference and remember (like #123). This is especially important for collaboration and issue tracking workflows.",
    "technicalContext": "Current ID system uses deterministic hash-based generation (title + type). Need to replace with auto-incrementing integers stored persistently. This affects storage layer, API endpoints, UI components, and URL routing. Must ensure thread-safety and handle concurrent entry creation.",
