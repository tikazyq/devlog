      "content": "## ✅ Visual Elements Fixed\n\n### 1. Business/Technical Context Alerts Restored\n- **Business Context**: Blue `info` alert with `InfoCircleOutlined` icon\n- **Technical Context**: Orange `warning` alert with `ToolOutlined` icon\n- Both now contain MarkdownRenderer for rich formatting within colored alerts\n\n### 2. Enhanced List Styling\n- ✅ Proper bullet points for unordered lists (`disc`, `circle`, `square` for nested)\n- ✅ Proper numbering for ordered lists (`decimal`, `lower-alpha`, `lower-roman` for nested)\n- ✅ Better spacing and indentation (24px padding-left, 4px item spacing)\n- ✅ Improved line height (1.6) for readability\n- ✅ Support for nested lists with different bullet styles\n\n### 3. Alert-Specific CSS\n- Added CSS rules for markdown content inside Alert components\n- Proper margin handling for first/last elements in alerts\n- Better typography hierarchy within colored alert boxes\n\n### Result\nNow both visual distinction and markdown formatting work together perfectly!"
