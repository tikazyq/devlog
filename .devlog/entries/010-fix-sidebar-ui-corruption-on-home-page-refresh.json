      "content": "Implemented comprehensive fix for sidebar UI corruption on home page refresh:\n\n**Root Cause Identified**: Hydration mismatches between server-side rendering and client-side rendering when using Next.js routing hooks (usePathname, useRouter) before the component is fully mounted.\n\n**Solution Applied**:\n1. **Hydration Safety**: Added `mounted` state to both AppLayout and NavigationSidebar to prevent rendering routing-dependent content during SSR\n2. **Loading Experience**: Created AppLayoutSkeleton component to show proper loading state instead of blank screen\n3. **CSS Architecture**: Fixed component style imports and added skeleton-specific styles\n4. **Navigation State**: Added safety checks to prevent navigation actions before component is ready\n\n**Testing Needed**: Verify that home page refresh and direct URL visits now work correctly without UI corruption."
