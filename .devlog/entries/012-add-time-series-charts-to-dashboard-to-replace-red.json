  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Replace the redundant statistics cards in the Dashboard component with time series charts that show development progress over time. The current design has duplicate statistics displayed both in compact form at the top and as detailed cards in the main content area. Time series charts will provide more valuable insights into development trends and progress patterns.",

      "content": "Completed: Successfully replaced redundant statistics cards in the Dashboard component with interactive time series charts. The implementation uses recharts to display development activity trends (created vs completed devlogs) and status distribution changes over a 30-day period. This provides much more valuable insights than the duplicate statistics that were previously shown. The charts are responsive and maintain proper styling. Future enhancement would involve backend integration to provide real historical data."
