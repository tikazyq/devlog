  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Replace the redundant statistics cards in the Dashboard component with time series charts that show development progress over time. The current design has duplicate statistics displayed both in compact form at the top and as detailed cards in the main content area. Time series charts will provide more valuable insights into development trends and progress patterns.",

Added two charts: 1) Development Activity showing created vs completed devlogs over 30 days, 2) Status Distribution Trends showing how different statuses change over time.
