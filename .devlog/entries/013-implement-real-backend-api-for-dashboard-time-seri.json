  "description": "Implement real backend API support for dashboard time series charts. This involves creating new API endpoints to provide historical statistics data, extending the core devlog manager to aggregate data over time periods, and updating the frontend to consume real data instead of mock data.",

Plan: 1) Add time series interfaces to types, 2) Extend DevlogManager with time series methods, 3) Create new API endpoint, 4) Update Dashboard component."

Extended the type system with time series interfaces, added historical data aggregation to DevlogManager, created a new API endpoint, and updated the Dashboard component to consume real data instead of mock data. Also improved the user experience by replacing the status distribution trends line chart with a more appropriate pie chart showing current status distribution. The implementation provides real historical insights and establishes a solid foundation for future analytics features."
