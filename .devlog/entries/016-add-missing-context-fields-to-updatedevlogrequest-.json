      "content": "Successfully implemented the fix! The issue was that the MCP tool schema and TypeScript UpdateDevlogRequest interface had inconsistent parameter names. Fixed by standardizing both to use camelCase naming (files instead of files_changed, codeChanges instead of code_changes) and added missing fields (blockers, nextSteps). All context fields now update properly."
