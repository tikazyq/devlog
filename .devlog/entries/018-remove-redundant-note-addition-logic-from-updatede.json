The updateDevlog method should only handle updating entity fields, while the addNote method should be the sole way to add notes. This separation improves code clarity, follows single responsibility principle, and eliminates redundant code paths.",

    "businessContext": "The DevlogManager has inconsistent handling of note creation. The updateDevlog method currently creates notes when a progress field is provided, duplicating functionality that already exists in the dedicated addNote method. This violates single responsibility principle and creates confusion about which method should be used for adding notes.",
    "technicalContext": "The updateDevlog method in packages/core/src/devlog-manager.ts contains logic to create DevlogNote objects when request.progress is provided. This duplicates the note creation logic in the addNote method. The MCP adapter and completeDevlog method already properly use addNote for note creation.",
