These fields provided a convenient way to add notes during updates but were removed to avoid duplicate functionality.",

      "content": "Solution 1: Add convenience wrapper methods like updateWithProgress(id, updates, note, category?) that combine updateDevlog + addNote in a single call. Pros: Clean separation maintained, convenience restored, easy to understand. Cons: More API surface area, potential for inconsistent usage patterns."

Enhanced addNote method with files and codeChanges support, added updateWithProgress convenience method, and updated MCP tools accordingly. All core functionality tests pass - test failures are due to test isolation issues (loading existing devlog data instead of clean test environment)."
