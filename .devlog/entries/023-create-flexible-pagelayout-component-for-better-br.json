  "description": "Refactor the current rigid layout structure in @devlog/web to introduce a flexible PageLayout component that allows pages to customize the breadcrumb area, add action buttons on the right side, and have more control over the main content layout. The current AppLayout forces all pages into a fixed structure that doesn't allow for page-specific customizations.",
