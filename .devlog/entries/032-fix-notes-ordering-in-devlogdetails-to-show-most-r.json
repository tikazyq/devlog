Changed `devlog.notes.map()` to `[...devlog.notes].reverse().map()` to show most recent notes first while preserving the original data structure.

The notes now display in reverse chronological order (most recent first) by using `[...devlog.notes].reverse().map()` instead of `devlog.notes.map()`. This improves user experience by showing the latest updates first, which is what users naturally expect when reviewing devlog progress."

    "businessContext": "Users naturally expect to see the most recent information first when reviewing devlog entries. Having the latest notes at the bottom forces users to scroll down to see recent updates, which creates a poor user experience especially for devlogs with many notes.",
    "technicalContext": "The DevlogDetails component renders notes using a Timeline component that maps over the devlog.notes array. The notes array is stored in chronological order (oldest first) in the data model. To display most recent first, we need to reverse the array before rendering without modifying the underlying data structure.",
