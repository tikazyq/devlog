  "type": "refactor",
  "description": "Improve the EditableField component UX to provide a seamless transition between read and edit modes, similar to Azure DevOps. Instead of completely swapping rendered content between states, implement a solution where the field can be focused and input like a native input while maintaining visual alignment with the read mode content. This will eliminate the jarring UX of content swapping and provide a more intuitive editing experience.",

      "content": "Refactored EditableField component to use Ant Design's design system and borderless input variants. Eliminated the jarring content swap by:\n\n1. Using Ant Design's `variant=\"borderless\"` for inputs to create seamless visual integration\n2. Replaced custom CSS with Ant Design tokens and classes\n3. Added hover state with edit icon indicator\n4. Maintained all existing keyboard shortcuts and functionality\n5. Used CSS classes instead of inline styles to comply with linting rules\n\nThe component now provides a much more natural editing experience similar to Azure DevOps, where the field visually stays in the same place but becomes interactive when clicked.",
