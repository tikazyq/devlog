  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Add save button functionality to DevlogDetails component with changed flag system that:\n1. Tracks when any editable field has been modified locally \n2. Shows visual indicator (changed flag) when there are unsaved changes\n3. Provides save button to commit all changes to backend at once\n4. Allows users to discard changes and revert to original values\n5. Prevents accidental data loss by warning users about unsaved changes\n\nThis improves UX by giving users control over when changes are persisted and making it clear when there are uncommitted modifications.",

      "content": "Successfully implemented save button with changed flag system for DevlogDetails component. Key achievements:\n\n✅ **Architecture**: Moved save/discard buttons to page actions area instead of inline alerts\n✅ **State Management**: Implemented local change tracking that distinguishes between original and modified values\n✅ **Visual Indicators**: Added orange left border on changed fields using CSS pseudo-elements\n✅ **Parent-Child Communication**: Created callback system for DevlogDetails to notify parent page about unsaved changes\n✅ **User Experience**: Save/discard buttons only appear when there are actual changes\n✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error states and user feedback via message notifications\n✅ **Type Safety**: Used proper TypeScript interfaces and type-safe field access\n\nThe implementation provides intuitive UX where users can make multiple changes before committing, with clear visual feedback about what has been modified.",
