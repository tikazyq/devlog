  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The current WebSocket implementation is not functional - the WS endpoint returns 501 error and doesn't work with Next.js App Router. Need to implement proper real-time data synchronization between frontend and backend so that when devlog data is updated (create/update/delete operations), all connected clients automatically receive the latest data without manual refresh.",

      "content": "Successfully implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) as a replacement for the broken WebSocket implementation. Key changes:\n\n1. **New SSE Implementation**: Created `/api/events` endpoint with streaming support for real-time communication\n2. **Real-time Updates**: Modified all devlog CRUD endpoints to broadcast changes via SSE\n3. **Client Integration**: Implemented `useServerSentEvents` hook to replace `useWebSocket`\n4. **Updated useDevlogs**: Modified to use SSE for real-time updates instead of manual refetching\n5. **Build Fixes**: Resolved SSR issues by adding proper client-side checks and dynamic rendering\n\nThe application now builds successfully and development server is running on port 3001. SSE is more compatible with Next.js App Router than WebSocket.",

Users will see updates immediately when devlog entries are created, updated, or deleted by any connected client.",
