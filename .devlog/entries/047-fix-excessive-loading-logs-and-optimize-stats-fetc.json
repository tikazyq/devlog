  "description": "The web application is showing excessive log messages \"[WEB] Loading devlog index from /Users/marvzhang/projects/codervisor/devlog/.devlog/index.json\" (appearing 20+ times). This is caused by:\n\n1. A console.debug statement in json-storage.ts loadIndex() method that logs every file system access\n2. Stats being refetched in AppLayout.tsx every time devlogs change via SSE, creating unnecessary API calls\n\nThis creates noise in logs and potential performance issues with excessive file system access and API calls.",
