  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Create a hierarchical sticky headings component similar to VS Code/Monaco/JetBrains IDEs. When scrolling through a long page, the current active heading (e.g., h2) sticks to the top, with its parent heading (h1) also visible above it. This provides visual context and navigation aids for long content.",
