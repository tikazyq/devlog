Supporting Utilities:**\n- `GitHubAPIClient`: Clean GitHub REST API abstraction with proper authentication\n- `DevlogGitHubMapper`: Bidirectional mapping between DevlogEntry and GitHub Issues using structured JSON metadata in issue body\n- `GitHubLabelManager`: Automatic creation and management of devlog-specific labels\n- `RateLimiter`: Intelligent GitHub API rate limiting with retry logic\n- `LRUCache`: Custom LRU cache implementation with TTL support\n\n**4. Integration:**\n- Updated `StorageProviderFactory` to support GitHub storage type\n- Added GitHub storage exports to core package\n- Comprehensive test suite (11 tests passing)\n\n**5. Data Mapping Strategy:**\n- DevlogEntry fields map to GitHub Issue fields (ID, title, assignee, etc.)\n- Complex data stored as structured JSON in issue body with human-readable sections\n- Label-based encoding for type, status, and priority\n- Support for GitHub's native features (state, assignees, timestamps)\n\n**Key Features Implemented:**\nâœ… Complete CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete/close)\nâœ… Advanced search and filtering using GitHub's search API\nâœ… Rate limiting with intelligent backoff (respects GitHub's 5000 req/hr limit)\nâœ… Caching with configurable TTL (default 5 minutes)\nâœ… Label management with automatic devlog label creation\nâœ… Error handling for network issues, API errors, and malformed data\nâœ… Configuration validation and normalization\nâœ… Comprehensive test coverage\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Create example configuration and documentation\n- Add integration tests with actual GitHub API (optional)\n- Enhance statistics collection with actual label-based counts\n- Add migration utilities for moving between storage types",
