  "description": "Fix the hierarchical structure of headings in DevlogDetails component so that sticky headings work properly. Currently all sections (Description, Business Context, Technical Context, etc.) use `Title level={4}` creating flat h4 elements. Need to restructure them with proper heading hierarchy (h2 for main sections, h3 for subsections) so the existing StickyHeadings component can display meaningful hierarchical context when scrolling.",

    "technicalContext": "Replace the complex StickyHeadings component approach with simple CSS `position: sticky` for DevlogDetails section headings. This will provide a more natural, VS Code-like experience where section headings (Description, Business Context, Technical Context, etc.) stick to the top when scrolling past them. The current StickyHeadings component is overly complex and relies on HTML tag detection rather than natural CSS sticky positioning.",
