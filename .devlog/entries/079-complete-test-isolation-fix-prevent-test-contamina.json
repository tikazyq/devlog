  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "Fixed the dangerous test cleanup that was deleting real devlog data, but tests still not properly isolated. Tests are accumulating data across runs (78 entries instead of 2 expected). Even with global: false and .devlog-test directory, DevlogManager seems to find real storage. Need complete isolation.",

Still need to solve the isolation issue - tests are reading accumulated data (78 entries) instead of starting clean. Will try a different approach using dependency injection or mocking to completely isolate storage."
