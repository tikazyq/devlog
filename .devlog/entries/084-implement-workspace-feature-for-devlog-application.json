  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Implement a workspace feature that allows the devlog application to isolate work items using different workspaces. This will replace the current basic config file approach with a more sophisticated multi-workspace system where each workspace can have its own storage configuration and isolated devlog entries.",

    "businessContext": "The current devlog application uses a single configuration file for storage, which means all devlog entries are stored in one place. This limits the ability to separate work for different projects, teams, or contexts. A workspace feature would allow users to maintain separate devlog instances for different purposes (e.g., personal vs work projects, different clients, different repositories).",
    "technicalContext": "Current architecture uses ConfigurationManager to load a single devlog.config.json file and create one storage provider. We need to extend this to support multiple named workspaces, each with their own storage configuration. This will require changes to configuration management, storage provider factory, DevlogManager, and the MCP interface to handle workspace context.",
