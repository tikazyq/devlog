# Project Cleanup Summary

## Completed Actions

### Scripts Cleanup
- Moved 22 development/demo scripts to `scripts/archive/`
- Kept 4 active scripts in `scripts/`:
  - `test-mcp-compliance.mjs` (used by npm script)
  - `check-github-repo.mjs`
  - `check-token-scopes.mjs`
  - `get-github-project-id.mjs`
- Removed `test:quick` npm script (outdated test script)

### Documentation Cleanup
- Moved 4 development-specific docs to `docs/archive/`:
  - `REFACTORING.md`
  - `STANDARDIZED_ID_SOLUTION.md`
  - `STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md`
  - `DOGFOODING.md`
- Kept 6 user-facing docs in root:
  - `README.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `EXAMPLES.md`
  - `TESTING.md`
  - `GITHUB_SETUP.md`
  - `INTEGRATIONS.md`

### Demo Files Cleanup
- Moved 4 demo/test files from root to `scripts/archive/root-demos/`:
  - `demo-ai-context.js`
  - `demo-storage-architecture.mjs`
  - `test-ai-context.js`
  - `test-ai-context.mjs`

## Archive Structure
- `scripts/archive/` - Development scripts and demos
- `scripts/archive/root-demos/` - Demo files that were in project root
- `docs/archive/` - Implementation-specific documentation
- Both archive directories have README.md files explaining their contents

## Benefits
- Cleaner project structure
- Easier navigation for new users
- Preserved historical development files for reference
- Maintained all npm scripts and build processes
- Separated user-facing docs from implementation details

## Next Steps
- Archive directories can be removed in the future if not needed
- Consider moving GitHub-related scripts to a separate tools directory if they grow
