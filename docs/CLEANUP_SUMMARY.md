# Project Cleanup Summary

## Completed Actions

### Scripts Cleanup
- Moved 22 development/demo scripts to `scripts/archive/`
- Kept 4 active scripts in `scripts/`:
  - `test-mcp-compliance.mjs` (used by npm script)
  - `check-github-repo.mjs`
  - `check-token-scopes.mjs`
  - `get-github-project-id.mjs`
- Removed `test:quick` npm script (outdated test script)

### Documentation Cleanup
- Moved 7 markdown files to organized structure:
  - **Moved to `docs/guides/`**: `EXAMPLES.md`, `TESTING.md`, `GITHUB_SETUP.md`, `INTEGRATIONS.md`
  - **Moved to `docs/`**: `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`
- **Kept 2 essential docs in root**: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Created `docs/README.md`** - Navigation guide for all documentation
- **Updated references** in main README to point to new locations

### Demo Files Cleanup
- Moved 4 demo/test files from root to `scripts/archive/root-demos/`:
  - `demo-ai-context.js`
  - `demo-storage-architecture.mjs`
  - `test-ai-context.js`
  - `test-ai-context.mjs`

## Archive Structure
- `scripts/archive/` - Development scripts and demos
- `scripts/archive/root-demos/` - Demo files that were in project root
- `docs/archive/` - Implementation-specific documentation
- Both archive directories have README.md files explaining their contents

## Benefits
- **Much cleaner project structure**
- **Easier navigation for new users**
- **Organized documentation in logical hierarchy**
- **Preserved historical development files for reference**
- **Maintained all npm scripts and build processes**
- **Separated user-facing docs from implementation details**
- **Clear documentation navigation via docs/README.md**

## Next Steps
- Archive directories can be removed in the future if not needed
- Consider moving GitHub-related scripts to a separate tools directory if they grow
