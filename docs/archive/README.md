# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that was created during development but is no longer current or needed for regular use.

## Files

- **REFACTORING.md**: Documentation of the DevlogManager refactoring process
- **STANDARDIZED_ID_SOLUTION.md**: Detailed documentation of the standardized ID generation solution implementation
- **STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md**: Storage architecture documentation from development
- **DOGFOODING.md**: Examples of using devlog to track its own development (may contain outdated examples)

These documents are preserved for historical context and reference, but the main project documentation should be consulted for current information.
