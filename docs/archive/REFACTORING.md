# DevlogManager Refactoring - Migration Guide

## Overview

The DevlogManager has been refactored from a monolithic class into a modular architecture to improve maintainability, testability, and code organization. This document explains the changes and how to migrate.

## New Architecture

The DevlogManager is now composed of several focused modules:

### Core Modules

1. **DevlogManager** (`devlog-manager-v2.ts`) - Main orchestrator class
2. **FileSystemStorage** (`storage/file-system-storage.ts`) - File I/O operations
3. **DevlogOperations** (`operations/devlog-operations.ts`) - Core business logic
4. **EnterpriseSync** (`integrations/enterprise-sync.ts`) - External system integrations
5. **DevlogUtils** (`utils/devlog-utils.ts`) - Utility functions

### Benefits

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a focused purpose
- **Better Testing**: Modules can be tested in isolation
- **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one concern don't affect others
- **Extensibility**: New storage backends or integrations can be added easily

## Migration Guide

### For Most Users

**No changes required!** The public API of DevlogManager remains the same. Your existing code will continue to work without modifications.

```typescript
// This still works exactly the same
import { DevlogManager } from '@devlog/core';

const manager = new DevlogManager({
  workspaceRoot: '/path/to/workspace'
});
```

### For Advanced Users

If you want to use the new modular architecture directly:

```typescript
// New modular approach
import { 
  DevlogManager, // This is the new modular version
  FileSystemStorage,
  DevlogOperations,
  EnterpriseSync
} from '@devlog/core';

// Option 1: Use the orchestrator (recommended)
const manager = new DevlogManager({
  workspaceRoot: '/path/to/workspace',
  integrations: { /* your integrations */ }
});

// Option 2: Compose modules manually (advanced)
const storage = new FileSystemStorage('/path/to/.devlog');
const enterpriseSync = new EnterpriseSync(integrations);
const operations = new DevlogOperations(storage, enterpriseSync);
```

### For Package Developers

If you're building on top of DevlogManager, you can now depend on individual modules:

```typescript
import { DevlogStorage } from '@devlog/core';

// Implement your own storage backend
class DatabaseStorage implements DevlogStorage {
  // Implement interface methods
}

// Use with operations
const operations = new DevlogOperations(new DatabaseStorage());
```

## File Structure Changes

### Before
```
src/
  devlog-manager.ts    (1000+ lines)
  index.ts
```

### After
```
src/
  devlog-manager.ts         (original - still works)
  devlog-manager-v2.ts      (new modular orchestrator)
  storage/
    file-system-storage.ts  (file I/O operations)
  operations/
    devlog-operations.ts    (core business logic)
  integrations/
    enterprise-sync.ts      (Jira, ADO, GitHub sync)
  utils/
    devlog-utils.ts         (utility functions)
  index.ts                  (exports all modules)
```

## Testing the New Architecture

A comprehensive test suite has been added to verify the modular architecture:

```bash
cd packages/core
pnpm test src/__tests__/devlog-manager-v2.test.ts
```

## Backwards Compatibility

- ✅ **Public API**: No breaking changes
- ✅ **File Format**: No changes to stored devlog files
- ✅ **Integrations**: All enterprise integrations work the same
- ✅ **MCP Server**: No changes required

## Future Plans

- The original monolithic `devlog-manager.ts` will be deprecated in v2.0
- New features will be added to the modular architecture
- Documentation will be updated to reflect the new structure
