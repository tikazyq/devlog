# Monorepo Dev Experience Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

Previously, when developing application packages (`@devlog/web`, `@devlog/mcp`), changes to base packages (`@devlog/types`, `@devlog/core`) required manual rebuilding. This led to a poor developer experience where changes in dependencies weren't immediately available.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Development Scripts

**Root Level:**
- `pnpm dev:mcp` - Runs MCP server with auto-building dependencies
- `pnpm dev:web` - Runs web app with auto-building dependencies

**Package Level:**
- `dev:full` scripts added to application packages for local development

### 2. Automatic Dependency Watching

Each enhanced dev script uses `concurrently` to run:
1. `@devlog/types` in TypeScript watch mode (`tsc --watch`)
2. `@devlog/core` in TypeScript watch mode (`tsc --watch`)  
3. The target application package in dev mode

### 3. VS Code Integration

Updated `.vscode/tasks.json` with new tasks:
- **MCP Server: Dev (Full Stack)** - Global script
- **Web: Dev (Full Stack)** - Global script  
- **Web: Dev (Local Full Stack)** - Package-specific script

### 4. Visual Output

Color-coded console output using `concurrently`:
- **TYPES** (cyan) - TypeScript compilation for types package
- **CORE** (green) - TypeScript compilation for core package
- **MCP** (yellow) - MCP server output
- **WEB** (blue) - Next.js dev server output

## Files Modified

### Package Scripts
- `/package.json` - Added `dev:mcp` and `dev:web` scripts
- `/packages/web/package.json` - Added `dev:full` script and dev variants
- `/packages/mcp/package.json` - Added `dev:full` script

### VS Code Configuration
- `/.vscode/tasks.json` - Added new full-stack dev tasks

### Dependencies
- Added `concurrently` to root and application packages

### Documentation
- `/docs/guides/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Comprehensive development guide
- `/README.md` - Updated development section

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Real-time Updates**: Changes in base packages immediately trigger rebuilds
2. **No Manual Intervention**: No need to run `pnpm build` when dependencies change
3. **Better Visibility**: Color-coded output makes it easy to see which package is building/running
4. **VS Code Integration**: Easy access through Command Palette
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: Legacy scripts still work for specific use cases

## Development Workflow

Before:
```bash
# Edit @devlog/types or @devlog/core
# Run: pnpm build:types && pnpm build:core
# Run: pnpm dev
```

After:
```bash
# Run once: pnpm dev:mcp (or pnpm dev:web)
# Edit any package - changes automatically propagate
```

## Testing

Both `pnpm dev:mcp` and `pnpm dev:web` were tested and confirmed working:
- TypeScript compilation starts for base packages
- Application servers start successfully
- Watch mode detects and processes file changes
- Color-coded output provides clear visibility

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
1. Hot module replacement for faster iteration
2. Additional IDE integrations (IntelliJ, etc.)
3. Automated testing in watch mode
4. Performance monitoring for build times
