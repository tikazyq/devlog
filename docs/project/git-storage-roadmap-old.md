## Notes

- Focus on core functionality first, polish later
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
- Use existing devlog for testing and validation
- Document any breaking changes clearly

## Critical Implementation Guidelines

### Storage Separation (IMPORTANT!)
- **Git Repository (`.devlog/` folder)**: JSON files, metadata, documentation - TRACKED
- **Local Cache (`~/.devlog/` directory)**: SQLite files, temp files - NEVER TRACKED
- Always verify SQLite files are in `~/.devlog/`, never in git repos
- Add proper `.gitignore` entries to prevent accidental SQLite commits

### Configuration Strategy Priority
1. **local-sqlite**: Traditional local-only storage (existing behavior)
2. **git-json**: Pure git-based JSON storage (new, GitHub/GitLab friendly)
3. **hybrid-git**: Best of both worlds (git JSON + local SQLite cache)

### File Structure Standards
```
# Git Repository
.devlog/
  entries/2024-01-15-feature.json    # Individual entry files
  index.json                         # Entry metadata and relationships
  config.json                        # Repository-specific config

# Local User Directory  
~/.devlog/
  cache/project-name.db              # SQLite cache for hybrid strategy
  local/local-project.db             # SQLite for local-only projects
```
