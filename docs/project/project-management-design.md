# AI-Native Project Management Feature Design

**Status**: Designed (AI-Native Approach)  
**Target Version**: v2.0.0  
**Created**: July 10, 2025  
**Devlog Entry**: #52

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for an AI-native hierarchical project management feature that extends the existing devlog system. While using familiar Project/Epic/Task terminology, the system is optimized for AI agent workflows with session-based tracking, complexity estimation, and context management instead of traditional time-based planning.

## Problem Statement

The current devlog system excels at tracking individual tasks but lacks organization for larger initiatives that:

- Span multiple AI sessions requiring context rebuilding
- Involve complex knowledge dependencies and learning curves
- Need AI-optimized problem decomposition and complexity assessment
- Require context-aware planning based on AI cognitive load

## AI-Native Solution Overview

### Familiar Hierarchy with AI Intelligence

1. **Project** - Multi-session problem space requiring context persistence
2. **Epic** - Coherent 1-3 session challenges with knowledge prerequisites
3. **Task** - Atomic AI actions with complexity assessment

### AI-Optimized Capabilities

- **Session-based tracking** instead of time estimates
- **Complexity assessment** based on AI cognitive load and context requirements
- **Knowledge dependency mapping** for prerequisite learning
- **Context optimization** to minimize token costs between sessions
- **AI learning pattern recognition** for adaptive improvement

## AI-Native Architecture Design

### Enhanced DevlogEntry for AI Agents

```typescript
export interface DevlogEntry {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // Hierarchy fields (familiar terminology)
  parentId?: DevlogId;
  childIds: DevlogId[];
  hierarchyLevel: 'project' | 'epic' | 'task';
  rootProjectId?: DevlogId;

  // AI-native fields (replacing time-based planning)
  complexityEstimate?: 'trivial' | 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex' | 'research';
  contextRequirement?: 'local' | 'cross-file' | 'system-wide';
  expectedSessions?: number; // Expected AI sessions (not hours)
  knowledgePrerequisites?: string[]; // What AI needs to know
  toolRequirements?: string[]; // Required AI tools
  uncertaintyLevel?: 'known' | 'exploratory' | 'research';

  // AI context tracking
  contextTokensUsed?: number; // Tokens consumed for context
  successProbability?: number; // AI confidence in success
}
```

### AI Session Context System

```typescript
export interface SessionContext {
  requiredKnowledge: string[];
  estimatedTokens: number;
  toolsNeeded: string[];
  contextCost: number;
  knowledgeGaps: string[];
}

export interface AILearningPattern {
  patternType: string;
  contextSignature: string;
  successRate: number;
  complexityFactors: string[];
}
```

## AI-Native Implementation Approach

### Core Principles

1. **Familiar terminology** (Project/Epic/Task) with AI-optimized internals
2. **Session-based planning** instead of time-based estimates
3. **Context management** as the primary constraint
4. **Knowledge dependencies** replacing coordination dependencies
5. **Complexity assessment** based on AI cognitive load

### Essential MCP Tools

- `create_project` - Create project with AI complexity assessment
- `create_epic` - Create epic with session planning
- `assess_complexity` - Analyze AI cognitive load and context needs
- `build_session_context` - Prepare optimal context for AI session
- `analyze_knowledge_gaps` - Identify what AI needs to learn
- `track_session_learnings` - Record knowledge gained

### Key Success Metrics

- **Context Efficiency**: <30% of session time rebuilding context
- **Resolution Rate**: >80% success on first attempt
- **Knowledge Reuse**: >70% context persistence between sessions
- **Session Accuracy**: ±1 session from estimate

## Use Cases and Examples

## Use Cases and Examples

### Multi-Session AI Development

**Scenario**: Authentication system requiring knowledge across multiple domains

```
Project: Authentication System (complexity: research, sessions: 8-12)
├── Epic: Backend Integration (complexity: complex, sessions: 3-4)
│   ├── Task: JWT token design (complexity: moderate, context: system-wide)
│   ├── Task: User registration API (complexity: simple, context: local)
│   └── Task: Security implementation (complexity: complex, context: system-wide)
├── Epic: Frontend Integration (complexity: moderate, sessions: 2-3)
│   ├── Task: Auth UI components (complexity: simple, context: local)
│   └── Task: State management (complexity: moderate, context: cross-file)
└── Epic: Testing & Validation (complexity: moderate, sessions: 2-3)
    ├── Task: Security testing (complexity: complex, context: system-wide)
    └── Task: Integration testing (complexity: moderate, context: cross-file)
```

**AI Dependencies**: Backend security knowledge required before frontend integration sessions

### Complex System Migration

**Scenario**: Database migration with high uncertainty and learning requirements

```
Project: PostgreSQL Migration (complexity: research, sessions: 6-8, uncertainty: exploratory)
├── Epic: Analysis & Design (sessions: 2-3, knowledge: schema patterns, migration tools)
│   ├── Task: Schema analysis (complexity: moderate, tools: [database_tools])
│   └── Task: Migration strategy (complexity: complex, prerequisites: [postgres_knowledge])
└── Epic: Implementation (sessions: 3-4, knowledge: deployment, rollback procedures)
    ├── Task: Migration scripts (complexity: complex, context: system-wide)
    └── Task: Validation testing (complexity: moderate, context: cross-file)
```

**Knowledge Prerequisites**: PostgreSQL architecture, data migration patterns

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Requirements

**AI-Optimized Storage**

- Hierarchy fields with complexity tracking
- Session context serialization
- Knowledge dependency mapping
- Context token usage analytics

**Performance & Compatibility**

- Existing devlogs auto-tagged as "task" level
- Indexed hierarchy queries with complexity filtering
- Incremental context building for large projects

### Migration Approach

1. **Schema Extension**: Add AI-native fields to DevlogEntry
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Enable project creation without breaking existing workflows
3. **Context Optimization**: Implement session planning and complexity assessment tools

## AI Success Metrics

### AI Agent Autonomy (Primary Goal)
- **Human intervention rate** < 10% of total working time
- **Autonomous task completion** > 90% success rate without human guidance
- **Zero-touch operation time** - Measure continuous AI work periods without human attendance

### AI Performance Indicators
- **Context Efficiency**: <30% session time rebuilding context  
- **Session Accuracy**: ±1 session from complexity estimates  
- **Knowledge Reuse**: >70% context persistence between sessions  
- **Resolution Rate**: >80% first-attempt success on complex tasks

### Objective
The ideal objective is that the AI agent can work and deliver as expected with no human interaction at all - the AI agent is working autonomously. Human interventions should be measured and minimized as the primary success indicator.

## Future AI Enhancements

**v2.1**: Context optimization algorithms, learning pattern recognition  
**v2.2**: Automated complexity assessment, smart session planning  
**v2.3**: Cross-project knowledge transfer, AI coaching recommendations

## Conclusion

This AI-native project management enhancement transforms devlog from task tracking into intelligent session planning. By focusing on complexity assessment, context optimization, and knowledge dependency mapping instead of traditional time-based planning, the system becomes truly suited for AI agent workflows while maintaining familiar project organization patterns.
